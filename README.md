# Letf-to-Right-push
This is a small project to show the left to right push mechanism in Swift 3.0 (similar to the way Instagram has done in their app)

I created this repository to help anyone who is looking into ways of adding Left-to-right segue into their apps. As a bonus, I also added the swipe up to down segue. 
The whole project will mimic the way that Instagram works at the basic level of segue. 

Download the repo and play with it. You can add the the LeftToRightCustomSegue.swift and the SwipeUpDownSegue.swift files directly into your project to use the segues straight away. 

Happy coding!
